## BitAccess: Case Study

### Overview

BitAccess was founded in Ottawa in 2013 by Moe Adham, Haseeb Awan, Vignesh Sundaressan and Ryan Wallace. The founders initially met at Invest Ottawa - an economic development agency that fosters entrepreneurship, helps accelerate startups and provides scaling solutions to already established businesses [^1] - while working on different projects there. Once discovering the large potential through merging their skills and ambitions, their attention was switched from previous ventures to BitAccess. 

Bitcoin was becoming common although it did suffer from low usability due to the difficulty individuals faced acquiring the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin at the time could only be acquired via online exchanges or through in person meetings. Organizing meetings meant inconvenience and a risk for safety concerns for those involved in the exchange. With minimum buy limits, online exchanges were costly and people would have to go through a complicated process to set up an electronic wallet that had a technically complex nature. The founders pondered, by mixing the fast growth of Bitcoin with the familiarity of ATMs, through making the infrastructure available to the average user, this combination would ultimately change the cash industry and technology.
