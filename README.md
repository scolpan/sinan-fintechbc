## BitAccess: Case Study

### Overview

BitAccess was founded in Ottawa in 2013 by Moe Adham, Haseeb Awan, Vignesh Sundaressan and Ryan Wallace. The founders initially met at Invest Ottawa - an economic development agency that fosters entrepreneurship, helps accelerate startups and provides scaling solutions to already established businesses [^1] - while working on different projects there. Once discovering the large potential through merging their skills and ambitions, their attention was switched from previous ventures to BitAccess. 

Bitcoin was becoming common although it did suffer from low usability due to the difficulty individuals faced acquiring the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin at the time could only be acquired via online exchanges or through in person meetings. Organizing meetings meant inconvenience and a risk for safety for those involved in the exchange. With minimum buy limits, online exchanges were costly and people would have to go through a complicated process to set up an electronic wallet that had a technically complex nature. The founders pondered, by mixing the fast growth of Bitcoin with the familiarity of ATMs, through making the infrastructure available to the average user, this combination would ultimately change the cash industry and technology.

In 2014, BitAccess applied and was accepted to Y-Combinator, a Silicon Valley based startup accelerator with an acceptance rate of 1.5%.[^2] Y-Combinator offers admitted businesses an investment of $120,000 for a 7% equity share in the startup, which does not appear to be the most ideal financial bid, although it was appealing for the additional benefits it can provide. Previous Y-Combinator alumnis inclue companies like Airbnb. According to the founders of BitAccess, money was secondary to the overall benefits of the Y-Combinator program which offers access to contacts, workshops, investors and support from various program alumnis and partners which include serial entrepreneurs.[^3] The acceptance of BitAccess to Y-Combinator opened doors to massive growth potential and provided the team with access to further capital and networks. The founders eventually relocated to Silicon Valley to be placed in an environment where startups thrive with access to venture capital and a large talent pool of technical proffessionals.


### Bitcoin Teller Machine (BTM)

Essentially, BitAccess aims to revolutionize and disrupt the ATM and the payments industries. The key objective of the company is to re-engineer the design of the cash economy at hand, to make it more resilient and scalable.

The Bitcoin ATM (BTM) is a tangible device that allows individuals, based on the exchange rate, to buy and sell the digital cryptocurrency. The BTM intakes banknotes and delivers bitcoin to the user's electronic wallet. BitAccess' BTM also provides functionality to transfer bitcoin from one digital wallet to another and dispense cash by accepting the cryptocurrency. 

BitAccess' BTM has two types of customers: end users and operators. Operators typically consist of cash management companies and financial service providers. BitAccess generally forms a partnership with their operator customers. Through its BTMs, BitAccess serves as a conduit between bitcoin exchanges and operators that usually don't work together directly. BTM operators are able to white label their BTMs and operate independently by charging a fee to the end user when they buy and sell bitcoin. In essence, in order to run successfully, the operators need a source of bitcoins, which translates to a relationship with an exchange and, banks to manage the cash.

There are approximately 3.5M ATMs worldwide and an average ATM fee of \$5 per transaction with an average consumer visiting an ATM 6 times a month for an average withdrawal of $60.[^4] The BTMs are typically charging 5% to 10% per transaction to buy bitcoin and on average around 5% to 7% to sell.[^5] Given that bitcoin can be transferred between parties with no fees attached to it, it makes the platform a direct rival to traditional banks or financial service providers who are already issuing hefty fees for their services such as issuing company payments, money orders or remmittances. 

The BTMs simply consist of hardware and Software. By repurposing existing self-payment kiosks, the hardware was initially developed and made to look similar to conventional ATMs for familiarity and convenience. The software was created to allow the machine to buy, sell and move bitcoin through digital wallets.
