## BitAccess: Case Study

### Overview

BitAccess was founded in Ottawa in 2013 by Moe Adham, Haseeb Awan, Vignesh Sundaressan and Ryan Wallace. The founders initially met at Invest Ottawa - an economic development agency that fosters entrepreneurship, helps accelerate startups and provides scaling solutions to already established businesses[^1] - while working on different projects there. Once discovering the large potential through merging their skills and ambitions, their attention was switched from previous ventures to BitAccess. 

Bitcoin was becoming common although it did suffer from low usability due to the difficulty individuals faced acquiring the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin at the time could only be acquired via online exchanges or through in person meetings. Organizing meetings meant inconvenience and a risk for safety for those involved in the exchange. With minimum buy limits, online exchanges were costly and people would have to go through a complicated process to set up an electronic wallet that had a technically complex nature. The founders pondered, by mixing the fast growth of Bitcoin with the familiarity of ATMs, through making the infrastructure available to the average user, this combination would ultimately change the cash industry and technology.

In 2014, BitAccess applied and was accepted to Y-Combinator, a Silicon Valley based startup accelerator with an acceptance rate of 1.5%.[^2] Y-Combinator offers admitted businesses an investment of $120,000 for a 7% equity share in the startup, which does not appear to be the most ideal financial bid, although it was appealing for the additional benefits it can provide. Previous Y-Combinator alumnis inclue companies like Airbnb. According to the founders of BitAccess, money was secondary to the overall benefits of the Y-Combinator program which offers access to contacts, workshops, investors and support from various program alumnis and partners which include serial entrepreneurs.[^3] The acceptance of BitAccess to Y-Combinator opened doors to massive growth potential and provided the team with access to further capital and networks. The founders eventually relocated to Silicon Valley to be placed in an environment where startups thrive with access to a large network of technical proffessionals and the presence of large venture capital firms looking to invest in startups.


### Bitcoin Teller Machine (BTM)

Essentially, BitAccess aims to revolutionize and disrupt the ATM and the payments industries. The key objective of the company is to re-engineer the design of the cash economy at hand, to make it more resilient and scalable.

The Bitcoin ATM (BTM) is a tangible device that allows individuals, based on the exchange rate, to buy and sell the digital cryptocurrency. The BTM intakes banknotes and delivers bitcoin to the user's electronic wallet. BitAccess' BTM also provides functionality to transfer bitcoin from one digital wallet to another and dispense cash by accepting the cryptocurrency.

BitAccess' BTM has two types of customers: end users and operators. Operators typically consist of cash management companies and financial service providers. BitAccess generally forms a partnership with their operator customers. Through its BTMs, BitAccess serves as a conduit between bitcoin exchanges and operators that usually don't work together directly. BTM operators are able to white label their BTMs and operate independently by charging a fee to the end user when they buy and sell bitcoin. In essence, in order to run successfully, the operators need a source of bitcoins, which translates to a relationship with an exchange and, banks to manage the cash.

There are approximately 3.5M ATMs worldwide and an average ATM fee of \$5 per transaction with an average consumer visiting an ATM 6 times a month for an average withdrawal of $60.[^4] The BTMs are typically charging 5% to 10% per transaction to buy bitcoin and on average around 5% to 7% to sell.[^5] Given that bitcoin can be transferred between parties with no fees attached to it, it makes the platform a direct rival to traditional banks or financial service providers who are already issuing hefty fees for their services such as issuing company payments, money orders or remmittances. 

The BTMs simply consist of hardware and Software. By repurposing existing self-payment kiosks, the hardware was initially developed and made to look similar to conventional ATMs for familiarity and convenience. The software was created to allow the machine to buy, sell and move bitcoin through digital wallets. The company also provides operators tools to monitor and gather usage statistics on their deployed network of BTMs. BitAccess uses a number of languages to design and implement their software. These consist of, but are not limited to C++, Python and Javascript.[^6]


### Landscape

BitAccess' initial intent and the following experience in the disruption of the payments industry through bitcoin also gives them an edge in following and responding to developments in other areas of blockchain technology. One such example is the Ethereum blockchain network. While bitcoin was created to solely act as a digital currency, the purpose of Ethereum's currency - Ether - is not to establish itself as an alternative monetary system, but rather act as fuel to propel a decentralized software platform that enables the deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications.[^7] As a network, Ethereum enables the emergence of a low-cost sandbox for developers. The architecture of open source programming platforms mean that everyone can add information and programs to the framework's developer-available shared knowledge repository. Thus, when anyone produces something important, every other creator in the sandbox is able to take this construction to use it in their own product.[^8] This in turn results for a massive potential in innovation. Many technical individuals and large corporations such as ING Bank, Ubisoft and TD Ameritrade have since tapped into the world of Ethereum.[^9]

### Results

Going back to the BTM business, BitAccess generates revenue from the sale of their BTM units along with recurring income through charging operators service fees. The operator is free to charge the service fee they desire on their BTMs, typically averaging between 5%-7% per transaction. BitAccess charges 20% of their own service fee of the fee that the operator charges. I.e. if the operator charges 5% per transaction, BitAccess would be charging an additional 1%. The key advantage that BitAccess has over it's competitors is that it has adopted this franchising model with the intention to work with the current banking system rather than trying to replace it. BitAccess partners with stakeholders and this leads to help grow the companies network.[^10] 

The standard banking system is still dominant as the mainstream currency, considering the possible innovative value of Bitcoin. Therefore it is necessary to maintain partnerships with these mainstream platforms to perform business efficiently, safely and in a stable way. The founders of BitAccess believe in increasing productivity by incorporating bitcoin through the banking networks as opposed to aim at replacing banks. If the use of bitcoin becomes widespread, conventional banks may embrace and implement the white label approach and, in turn, massively increase the network of the software BitAccess built.[^10]

The core metrics that measure success for companies manufacturing Crypto ATM machines are typically growth oriented. Today, the statistics show that the total Crypto ATMs installed globally on a single day is on a definite upward trend. An average of new 38.6 CATMs get installed every day globally.[^11] BitAccess has manufactured 9.8% of total CATMs installed worldwide at 1507 machines, following Genesis Coin with 5890 machines and General Bytes with 4214 machines.[^12] 
Having BitAccess in the top 3 of the worlds biggest CATM manufacturers definitely puts BitAccess at an advantage for an industry that is eventually bound to face market saturation.
