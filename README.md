## BitAccess: Case Study

### Overview

BitAccess was founded in Ottawa in 2013 by Moe Adham, Haseeb Awan, Vignesh Sundaressan and Ryan Wallace. The founders initially met at Invest Ottawa - an economic development agency that fosters entrepreneurship, helps accelerate startups and provides scaling solutions to already established businesses[^1] - while working on different projects there. Once discovering the large potential through merging their skills and ambitions, their attention was switched from previous ventures to BitAccess.[^10]

Bitcoin was becoming common although it did suffer from low usability due to the difficulty individuals faced acquiring the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin at the time could only be acquired via online exchanges or through in person meetings. Organizing meetings meant inconvenience and a risk of safety for those involved in the exchange. With minimum buy limits, online exchanges were costly and people would have to go through a complicated process to set up an electronic wallet that had a technically complex nature. The founders contemplated, by integrating the fast growth of Bitcoin with the familiarity of ATMs, through making the infrastructure available to the average user, this combination would ultimately change the cash industry and technology.[^13]

In 2014, BitAccess applied and was accepted to Y-Combinator, a Silicon Valley based startup accelerator with an acceptance rate of 1.5%.[^2] Y-Combinator offers admitted businesses an investment of $120,000 for a 7% equity share of the startup. Perhaps this does not appear to be the most ideal financial bid, although it was appealing for the additional benefits it provided. Previous Y-Combinator alumni include companies such as Airbnb. According to the founders of BitAccess, money was secondary to the overall benefits of the Y-Combinator program which offers access to contacts, workshops, investors and support from various program alumni and partners which include serial entrepreneurs.[^3] The acceptance of BitAccess to Y-Combinator opened doors to massive growth potential and provided the team with access to further capital and networks. The founders eventually relocated to Silicon Valley in order to enter an environment where startups thrive by having access to a large network of technical professionals and the presence of large venture capital firms looking to invest in startups.[^13]


### Bitcoin Teller Machine (BTM)

Essentially, BitAccess aims to revolutionize and disrupt the ATM and payment industries. The key objective of the company is to re-engineer the design of the cash economy at hand, to make it more resilient and scalable.[^13]

The Bitcoin ATM (BTM) is a tangible device that allows individuals, based on the exchange rate, to buy and sell the digital cryptocurrency. The BTM intakes banknotes and delivers bitcoin to a user's electronic wallet. BitAccess' BTM also provides functionality to transfer bitcoin from one digital wallet to another and dispense cash by accepting the cryptocurrency.[^13]

BitAccess' BTM has two types of customers: end users and operators. Operators typically consist of cash management companies and financial service providers. BitAccess generally forms a partnership with their operator customers. Through its BTMs, BitAccess serves as a conduit between bitcoin exchanges and operators that usually do not work directly together. BTM operators are able to white label their BTMs and operate independently by charging a fee to the end user when they buy and sell bitcoin. In essence, in order to run successfully, the operators need a source of bitcoins, which translates to a relationship with an exchange, and in addition, a relationship with a bank to manage the cash.[^13]

There are approximately 3.5 million ATMs worldwide with an average ATM fee of \$5 per transaction. The average consumer visiting an ATM is approximately 6 times a month for an average withdrawal of $60.[^4] The BTMs are typically charging 5%-10% per transaction to purchase bitcoin and on average around 5%-7% to sell.[^5] Given that bitcoin can be transferred between parties with no fees attached to it, it can make the platform a direct rival to traditional banks or financial service providers who are already issuing hefty fees for their services such as issuing company payments, money orders or remmittances.[^10]

The BTMs simply consist of hardware and software. By repurposing existing self-payment kiosks, the hardware was initially developed and made to look similar to conventional ATMs for familiarity and convenience. The software was created to allow the machine to buy, sell and move bitcoin through digital wallets. The company also provides operators tools to monitor and gather usage statistics on their deployed network of BTMs.[^13] BitAccess uses a number of languages to design and implement their software. These consist of, but are not limited to C++, Python and Javascript.[^6]


### Landscape

BitAccess' initial intent and the following experience in the disruption of the payments industry through bitcoin also gives them an edge in following and responding to developments in other areas of blockchain technology. One such example is the Ethereum blockchain network. While bitcoin was created to solely act as a digital currency, the purpose of Ethereum's currency - Ether - is not to establish itself as an alternative monetary system, but rather act as fuel to propel a decentralized software platform that enables the deployment of smart contracts and decentralized applications.[^7] As a network, Ethereum enables the emergence of a low-cost sandbox for developers. The architecture of open source programming platforms mean that everyone can add information and programs to the framework's shared knowledge repository. Thus, when anyone produces something important, every other creator in the sandbox is able to take this construction to use it in their own product.[^8] This in turn results in a massive potential of innovation. Many technical individuals and large corporations such as ING Bank, Ubisoft and TD Ameritrade have since tapped into the world of Ethereum.[^9]


### Results

Going back to the BTM business, BitAccess generates revenue from the sale of their BTM units along with recurring income through charging operators service fees. The operator is free to charge the service fee they desire on their BTMs, typically averaging between 5%-7% per transaction. BitAccess charges 20% of their own service fee of the fee that the operator charges. For example, if the operator charges 5% per transaction, BitAccess would be charging an additional 1%. The key advantage that BitAccess has over its competitors is that it has adopted this franchising model with the intention to work with the current banking system rather than trying to replace it. BitAccess partners with stakeholders and this leads to help grow the companies network.[^10] 

The standard banking system is still dominant as the mainstream currency, considering the possible innovative value of Bitcoin. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain partnerships with these mainstream platforms to perform business efficiently. The founders of BitAccess believe in increasing productivity by incorporating bitcoin through the banking networks as opposed to aim at replacing banks. If the use of bitcoin becomes widespread, conventional banks may embrace and implement the white label approach and, in turn, greatly increase the network of the software BitAccess built.[^10]

The core metrics that measure success for companies manufacturing Crypto ATM machines are typically growth oriented. Today, the statistics show that the total Crypto ATMs installed globally on a single day is on a definite upward trend. An average, 38.6 CATMs get installed every day globally.[^11] BitAccess has manufactured 9.8% of total CATMs installed worldwide at 1507 machines, following Genesis Coin with 5890 machines and General Bytes with 4214 machines.[^12] 
Having BitAccess in the top 3 of the world's largest CATM manufacturers puts BitAccess at an advantage for an industry that is eventually bound to face market saturation.  


### Recommendations

BitAccess currently employs the white label strategy. If the bitcoin ecosystem were to develop into a mainstream standard currency, BitAccess could switch from their operator based model and instead form partnerships with companies that perform cash logistics in the ATM industry. BitAccess can be the provider of Software as a Service (SaaS) and build interfaces which would then allow partnering cash logistics companies to integrate the software into compatible traditional ATMs. This would enable further growth and greatly increase their revenues gathered from recurring transaction fees charged. In order to provide the SaaS solution, the developers at BitAccess would have to build robust and scalable APIs. Apart from the SaaS solution, BitAccess could increase their system's popularity by adapting and enabling their BTMs to exchange alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ether. Given Ether's sharp rise in value recently, along with its loyal followers that will constantly pick Ether over bitcoin - it may be a differentiating factor in the Crypto ATM market to partner with an exchange, in order to offer the solution to buy, sell and transfer between alternative popular cryptocurrencies through the CATM. The attractive part of this enhancement is that it can be done through a software update pushed through the network regardless of the CATM's global location. This update could in turn generate more revenue as the demand to use the CATMs will surely increase.
